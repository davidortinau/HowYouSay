# HowYouSay
Xamarin.Forms unfinished port of a Swift/Java app I wrote with Ben Bishop for Rendr. This is my ongoing playground.

## Current Explorations

Xamarin.Forms CSS with SASS
- https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Nightly-Builds
- [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

[HowYouSay/Shared/Styles/sass](https://github.com/davidortinau/HowYouSay/tree/master/HowYouSay.Shared/Styles/sass) is a nodejs project running gulp to process the scss files into css. Presently new css files must be manually added to the project and the build set to EmbeddedResource before Visual Studio can use them.

## Other Fun Herein

### Realm DB
I'd like to get this to a place where I'm using it for online/offline sync with Azure. 

### Localization
Since this is a language learning app, I took a shot at write the UI to handle localized strings from the start.
